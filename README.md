Hello Finra,

I made this short calculator demo to demonstrate many skills and understanding of automating a client side application. I added extra's that could be handled more effiencently using other libraries...But I chose to keep it barebones on purpose.

To run the script, follow these steps:
1.) Execute calc_gui.py (I made this into an .exe file complete with Finra icon procured from your website originally but chose to do without due to most industry standard security protocols)
2.) Click on 'Run Tests' button within the 'Calculator Test Runner' window
